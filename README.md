# Pathfinder Visualizer (Terminal Edition)

This is a Python-based terminal application that visually demonstrates pathfinding algorithms, specifically for solving mazes. It uses the `curses` library for a text-based user interface, allowing users to watch as the algorithm works to find a solution.

## Features
- **Real-time Visualization**: Watch the algorithm in action as it solves the maze step-by-step.
- **Multiple Pre-loaded Mazes**: Choose from several different mazes to solve.
- **Terminal-based UI**: Uses Python's built-in `curses` library for an interactive and colorful UI.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Currently supports Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.


working on creating a more interactive version of this made this as a fun side project
